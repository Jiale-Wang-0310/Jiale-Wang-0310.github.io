<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my page! I am Jiale Wang, and I have a strong passion for tackling technically challenging problems in biomedical intelligent systems. My research focuses on the <u>mechanical design and control of medical robots and bioelectronics</u>. I earned my B.S. degree in Automation from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2023, and I am currently pursuing an MPhil degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

At BUPT, I achieved a high GPA of <u>91.37/100</u> and ranked <u>1<sup>st</sup></u> in the comprehensive quality assessment for postgraduate recommendations. I received the <u>First-Class Scholarship</u> and the <u>Outstanding Student</u> award for two consecutive years. Furthermore, as a team leader, I guided my team in various engineering competitions related to robotics and mechanical design, resulting in <u>First Prize</u> and </u>Outstanding Winner</u> awards. Consequently, due to my excellent academic performance and extensive competition experience, I was honored as a <u>Beijing Outstanding Graduate</u>, the highest recognition for graduates, and received the <u>Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award (1/71 in department, top 1.4%)</u> for my undergraduate thesis. During my MPhil studies at HKUST, I maintained <u>straight A‚Äôs</u>, with a GPA of <u>4.0/4.3 (Excellent)</u>. Recently, I have been collaborating with the University of Hong Kong to conduct in vivo testing for a long-lasting gastric resident system.

In my future PhD career, I will further research biomedical intelligent systems to push the boundaries of medical robots and bioelectronic devices.

You can find my CV here: [CV](CV_JialeWang.pdf).
